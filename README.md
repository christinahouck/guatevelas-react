Using https://christinacodes.imgur.com/ for image hosting (other than the logos)

# TODOS
## General: 
* remove unnecessary buy links from products
* add motion back in
* performance - caching, resize images - very slow. 
* maybe add images here rather than using imgur
* clicking on a product page scrolls down for some reason? 

Homepage:
* check that the text & localization is ok 

Products page: 
* update buy button styling


## Nice-to-have: 
Homepage:
* swap out header image on homepage?
General:
* get the different URLs to default to whatever language the URLs are in
